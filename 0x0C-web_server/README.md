A web server is a computer program or hardware device that stores, processes, and serves web content to users over the internet. It's a fundamental component of the World Wide Web that enables websites and web applications to be accessible to users through their web browsers. When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, your browser sends a request to a web server to retrieve the corresponding web page or resource.
